    <p>I have been printing with my Prusa 3D printer (pictured above) for over 3 years now. The Prusa line of printers originates from the Czech Republic and arrived at my house as kit. This led to a lot of future tinker and upgrades with my printer. It has been very helpful for academic and personal projects. One of my favorite prints I made with it was a spikey red planter that I keep my Japanese peace lily in. In the near future, I hope to add a livestream of my printer in action using Octoprint and a Raspberry Pi.</p>
