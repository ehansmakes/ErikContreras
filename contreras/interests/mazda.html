    <p> When I have an open weekend, I like to take care of/work on my 1996 Mazda MPV sports van. I call it a sports van because it has 4 wheel drive, which comes in handy when I travel up to Tahoe to hit the slopes. Currently I am on the lookout for OEM fog lights to add to the front bumper. Other than that, the van has been driving well and looking decent to boot! Last year I took it to its first car show, RadWood, in the SF Bay Area. It got a surprisingly warm welcome! The picture above is my van at the Radwood event. Fun fact, the Wu-Tang Clan rapped about driving in a Mazda MPV on their hit 1993 song, C.R.E.A.M.. Another reason why the Mazda MPV is one of the cooler vans around. If you see me driving around Davis, feel free to say hi!</p>
