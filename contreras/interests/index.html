    <h1>Erik's Personal Site: Interests</h1>

    <p> Unfortunately, I do not have as much time as I would have liked to enjoy these interests below given my busy
        school schedule. On the other hand, "distance makes the heart grow fonder" and I am always in a good space when
        I find the time for these hobbies (^_^). Some minor interests that aren't listed include: 1)Reading Sci-Fi books
        (specifically from the cyberpunk subgenre), 2) playing video games (mostly indie titles from Devolver Digital),
        3)running, and 4) biking (both mountain and road).</p>
