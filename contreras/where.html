    <p>I currently live in Davis, California (USA). It is a fantastic place to live (when there aren't fires happening).
        The biggest perk to living here are the great people, and the fantastic biking. If you're new in town or just
        driving through, I recommend checking out the Bike Collective on 4th Street, the two Thrift Stores (Goodwill &
        SPCA), and grab a warm cup of coffee at Mishka's. I also recommend checking if there are any live shows
        happening around town. The local college radio station, KDVS, hosts a fantastic array of bands. The picture above
        is my house!</p>
