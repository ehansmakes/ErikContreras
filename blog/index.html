                <p><strong>A brief analysis of an article of interest regarding web design // web development:</strong>
                </p>

                <p>Over the Thanksgiving weekend, I found a fascinating article when I was browsing sidebar.io: Designed
                    to Deceive: Do These People Look Real to You?. It should be noted that the article was originally
                    published by the New York Times. In this write up, the author discusses the current trend of using
                    artificial intelligence (AI) generated faces to boost the number of positive reviews of a product,
                    create a realistic crowd for a video game, or to increase diversity on a company webpage (to name a
                    few examples. “There are now businesses that sell fake people. On the website Generated.Photos, you
                    can buy a “unique, worry-free” fake person for $2.99, or 1,000 people for $1,000.”Through the use of
                    AI, a potential customer to these services can generate the perfect face based on desired attributes
                    such as: 1) age, 2) perspective, 3) mood, 4) gender, 5) race and ethnicity. <a

                <p><strong>A brief analysis of an article of interest regarding web design // web development:</strong>
                </p>

                <p>The article I decided to take a deep dive into was “Cross-Cultural Design”. This article discussed
                    the importance of typography when it comes to creating rich cross-cultural experiences on the
                    internet. The first half of the article discussed the past pitfalls of forcing culture on text by
                    using stereotypical fonts and styles such as using the “<a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuland">Neuland</a> and <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithos">Lithos</a> [fonts] to signify Africans and
                    African-Americans or using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonton_font">Wonton</a> font
                    to express "Asianness". The author deems this insensitive use of typography as “Stereotypography” as
                    the design relies on stereotypes instead of authenticity to project a cross-cultural message. <a

                <p><strong>What makes for a good design portfolio site? </strong></p>

                <p>For inspiration I looked at 3 Portfolio sites for inspiration: 1) The Sartorialist, 2) !!! (Chk Chk
                    Chk) Band Website, and Blank Banshee’s band page. I felt that all three sites had their own unique
                    design language that reflected the topics they covered. The general design aspects I found in each
                    of these sites include having: 1) a navigation bar on the top portion of the window, 2) a unique
                    typeface for titles and menus, 3) an icon or logo that is present in both the banner and tab bar, 4)
                    consistent design queues between the pages, and external links to their social media sites and
                    contact pages.

                <h2>Blog Post 3</h2>
                <h2>HTML Deep Dive</h2>
                <time datetime="2020-11-15">November 15th, 2020</time>
                <p>After taking a deep dive in HTML, I found three cool aspects of the language that I would like to
                    share. I hope to include these elements in future updates of my webpages. The three cool tidbits of
                    HTML I found that were cool are: 1) <strong>abbr</strong>, 2) <strong>small</strong>, and 3)
                    <strong>sub</strong>.</p>
                <p>With <strong>abbr</strong> you can denote an abbreviation or acronym on your web page. As an added
                    bonus of functionality, you have the option to include a “title” attribute to provide an expansion
                    or description for the abbreviation that will pop up when you place your cursor over the abbreviated
                    word. For example, by stating the "title" for the abbreviated LOL as "laugh out loud", LOL would
                    provide a pop up text “laugh out loud” when the user places a cursor over LOL. This element will be
                    very helpful when I get around to creating a web page for my master’s research; I have a tendency to
                    use a lot of abbreviations in my research writings.

                <p><strong> Why did you choose the elements you used and how do they help describe the structure of the
                        content?</strong></p>
                <p>I chose the elements that I used for my blog’s design by trying to mimic the structure of a
                    newspaper. This gave me a page with multiple “article” elements inside the “main” element. After
                    reading: “HTML5 Semantic Tags: What Are They and How To Use Them!”, it is good to know that search
                    engines work best when a webpage uses elements correctly! <a href="posts/post2.html">Read More</a>

                <p>The decade I chose to research was the 1990's where I found two interesting pieces relating to the
                    internet. </p>
                <p>The first piece I found interesting was with a time period called "the Eternal Summer", which started
                    in September 1993. This event occurred when AOL started offering Usenet, an early messaging board
                    system originally limited to colleges and research institutions, access to its many non-academic
                    users. This growing popularity in AOL's Usernet service led the company to further distributing
                    "millions of floppy disks and CD-ROMs with free trials". This helped spearhead the popularity of the
                    internet with the general public in the mid-to-late 90's. This would explain why there are so many
                    AOL disks floating around my parent's house and thrift stores. <a href="posts/post1.html">Read
