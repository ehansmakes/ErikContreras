                <h2>Blog Post 3 - HTML Deep Dive</h2>
                <time datetime="2020-11-15">November 15th, 2020></time>
                <p>After taking a deep dive in HTML, I found three cool aspects of the language that I would like to
                    share. I hope to include these elements in future updates of my webpages. The three cool tidbits of
                    HTML I found that were cool are: 1) <strong>abbr</strong>, 2) <strong>small</strong>, and 3)
                    <strong>sub</strong>.</p>

                <p>With <strong>abbr</strong> you can denote an abbreviation or acronym on your web page. As an added
                    bonus of functionality, you have the option to include a “title” attribute to provide an expansion
                    or description for the abbreviation that will pop up when you place your cursor over the abbreviated
                    word. For example, by stating the "title" for the abbreviated LOL as "laugh out loud", LOL would
                    provide a pop up text “laugh out loud” when the user places a cursor over LOL. This element will be
                    very helpful when I get around to creating a web page for my master’s research; I have a tendency to
                    use a lot of abbreviations in my research writings.</p>

                <p>With <strong>small</strong> you can format text as side-comments or small print. This is an inline
                    text element. <strong>small</strong> would be helpful when adding things like copyright and legal
                    text that are independent of its styled presentation. This element would also be very helpful when I
                    create a website for my master’s research as it could be used for author’s notes and legal text.
                    Upon the discovery of the <strong>small</strong> element, I am curious to see how it is used by
                    search engines. Fun fact, I have started using <strong>small</strong> for my footer text!</p>

                <p>Finally, with <strong>sub</strong> you can add subscript elements to a character. This is an inline
                    text element. While this element is typically used for expressing equations or chemistry elements, I
                    would like to use this element for 𝕒𝕖𝕤𝕥𝕙𝕖𝕥𝕚𝕔<sub>🆂🆃🆈🅻🅸🅽🅶</sub>, although I would
                    assume this wouldn’t be picked up by search engines. It should be noted that subscripts are
                    typically rendered with a lowered baseline using smaller text.</p>
