                <h2>Blog Post 5 - Web Design Research 1</h2>
                <time datetime="2020-11-22">November 22nd, 2020</time>
                <p><strong>A brief analysis of an article of interest regarding web design // web development:</strong>
                </p>

                <p>The article I decided to take a deep dive into was “Cross-Cultural Design”. This article discussed
                    the importance of typography when it comes to creating rich cross-cultural experiences on the
                    internet. The first half of the article discussed the past pitfalls of forcing culture on text by
                    using stereotypical fonts and styles such as using the “<a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuland">Neuland</a> and <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithos">Lithos</a> [fonts] to signify Africans and
                    African-Americans or using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonton_font">Wonton</a> font
                    to express "Asianness". The author deems this insensitive use of typography as “Stereotypography” as
                    the design relies on stereotypes instead of authenticity to project a cross-cultural message.</p>

                <p>While I plan to create websites that take design queues from vintage//retro tech, I feel the lesson
                    of favoring authenticity over stereotypes still rings true.</p>

                <p>The second half of the article discussed some of the industry challenges when it comes to localizing
                    your website to different regions across the world; specifically when it comes to typography. I
                    found it interesting that “Google Fonts (and every other service using Google’s Developer API) is
                    blocked in mainland China”. This issue makes me rethink my approach to my website design and leads
                    me to believe that going with the “tried and true” approach would be preferable than trying to be
                    cutting edge with your website design. I feel this article gave me a better insight to website
                    design as the use of typography can really change the overall feel of a website.</p>
