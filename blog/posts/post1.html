                <h2>Blog Post 1 - History of the Internet</h2>
                <time datetime="2020-10-05">October 5th, 2020</time>
                <p>The decade I chose to research was the 1990's where I found two interesting pieces relating
                    to the
                    internet. </p>
                <p>The first piece I found interesting was with a time period called "the Eternal Summer", which
                    started
                    in September 1993. This event occurred when AOL started offering Usenet, an early messaging
                    board
                    system originally limited to colleges and research institutions, access to its many
                    non-academic
                    users. This growing popularity in AOL's Usernet service led the company to further
                    distributing
                    "millions of floppy disks and CD-ROMs with free trials"[1]. This helped spearhead the
                    popularity of
                    the internet with the general public in the mid-to-late 90's. This would explain why there
                    are so
                    many AOL disks floating around my parent's house and thrift stores. </p>
                <p>The second piece I found interesting was the use of Bulletin Board Systems (or BBS) in the
                    early-to-mid 90's. BBSes acted as a precursor to the modern form of the internet where users
                    could
                    talk to each other via chatrooms, and compete with each other in online games. In 1994
                    "there were
                    60,000 BBSes serving 17 million users in the United States alone" (according to InfoWorld)."
                    [2] The
                    introduction of inexpensive dial-up internet service and the Mosaic web browser offered ease
                    of use
                    and global access that BBS and online systems did not provide, and led to a rapid crash in
                    the
                    market starting in 1994." [3]</p>
                <p>Fun fact, there are BBS sites that are still running to this day. The oldest operational BBS
                    site is
                    Starfleet HQ, which has been running its "latest" release since 1994. The aesthetic of BBS
                    sites is
                    something I've seen before, but I never realized it was from an early form of the internet
                    until
                    now. I hope I could emulate similar designs in my future webpages given it bold color
                    schemes and
                    minimalistic approach to graphics. It makes me wonder if a minimalist approach is best given
                    the
                    variety of devices our webpages will have to be displayed on.</p>
