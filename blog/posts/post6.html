                <p><strong>A brief analysis of an article of interest regarding web design // web development:</strong>
                </p>

                <p>Over the Thanksgiving weekend, I found a fascinating article when I was browsing sidebar.io: Designed
                    to Deceive: Do These People Look Real to You?. It should be noted that the article was originally
                    published by the New York Times. In this write up, the author discusses the current trend of using
                    artificial intelligence (AI) generated faces to boost the number of positive reviews of a product,
                    create a realistic crowd for a video game, or to increase diversity on a company webpage (to name a
                    few examples. “There are now businesses that sell fake people. On the website Generated.Photos, you
                    can buy a “unique, worry-free” fake person for $2.99, or 1,000 people for $1,000.”Through the use of
                    AI, a potential customer to these services can generate the perfect face based on desired attributes
                    such as: 1) age, 2) perspective, 3) mood, 4) gender, 5) race and ethnicity.</p>

                <p>This has been an impressive feat in technology, as it has only been a recent development that we
                    could use AI to create these fake facades. “When the tech first appeared in 2014, it was bad — it
                    looked like the Sims,” said Camille François, a disinformation researcher whose job is to analyze
                    manipulation of social networks. It should be noted that like every AI system, there are human
                    biases embedded in the learning process.</p>

                <p>While I am excited to see where AI technology will take us and to see the many uses these AI
                    generated faces will bring, I am concerned that this would make fake news more difficult to track
                    down; especially with the recent developments in AI generation video. I feel this could be combated
                    by increasing the technical literacy amongst the general populace.</p>
