                <h2>Blog Post 4 - Portfolio Research</h2>
                <time datetime="2020-11-18">November 18th, 2020</time>
                <p><strong>What makes for a good design portfolio site? </strong></p>

                <p>For inspiration I looked at 3 Portfolio sites for inspiration: 1) The Sartorialist, 2) !!! (Chk Chk
                    Chk) Band Website, and Blank Banshee’s band page. I felt that all three sites had their own unique
                    design language that reflected the topics they covered. The general design aspects I found in each
                    of these sites include having: 1) a navigation bar on the top portion of the window, 2) a unique
                    typeface for titles and menus, 3) an icon or logo that is present in both the banner and/or tab bar,
                    4) consistent design queues between the pages, and external links to their social media sites and
                    contact pages. </p>

                </picture>
                <p><a href="https://www.thesartorialist.com/">The Sartorialist</a> is what I would consider a good
                    standard for a portfolio page. The banner provides enough information to inform the viewer what the
                    site is about and provides an easy navigation menu to traverse the site. The color scheme is
                    consistent and there are examples of the photographer’s most recent work on the menu page. Being
                    able to scroll down to view images allows the user to casually view the content. </p>
                <picture>
                    <img src="../images/chkchkchk.jpg" alt="chkchkchk" width="500" height="420">
                </picture>
                <p><a href="http://chkchkchk.net/music/">!!!</a>'s (Chk Chk Chk) portfolio page is a good example of
                    having fun with web page design while still allowing the end user to easily view their work. Some
                    fun effects include warping the images when the user scrolls down the site, and using a unique
                    cursor when on exploring certain pages. It should be noted that these design decisions did not
                    distract from the main content and gave the user an idea of the band's personality. The web page
                    designer also left some easter eggs around the site; such as when you inspect the HTML code on the
                    Music page you can find comments by the designer like: “ end of site. what a ride! “</p>

                </picture>
                <p><a href="https://www.blankbanshee.com/videos/">Blank Banshee</a>'s portfolio page was the final
                    website I explored for this entry. His website design was a good example of minimalist design with
                    the solid dark background giving emphasis to the artist’s work and low-poly inspired artwork. His
                    basic approach to web page design will be similar to my first design for my personal portfolio
                    website as it will allow me to focus on the backend design (coding HTML and CSS). </p>

                <p>Overall, I feel that all of these portfolios presented show good web page design, and I would like to
                    use elements of these designs in my personal portfolio. </p>
