                <h2>Blog Post 2 - Article Breakdown</h2>
                <time datetime="2020-11-08">November 8th, 2020</time>
                <p><strong> Why did you choose the elements you used and how do they help describe the structure
                        of
                        the content?</strong></p>
                <p>I chose the elements that I used for my blog’s design by trying to mimic the structure of a
                    newspaper. This gave me a page with multiple “article” elements inside the “main” element.
                    After
                    reading: “HTML5 Semantic Tags: What Are They and How To Use Them!”, it is good to know that
                    search engines work best when a webpage uses elements correctly!</p>
                <p><strong> What are you experimenting with and what kind of look are you trying to
                        achieve?</strong></p>
                <p> Regarding the aesthetics of my blog’s design, I have been trying to emulate the look of the
                    old
                    internet [mid 90’s to early 00’s]. While I feel that web design from this era wasn’t the
                    best,
                    such as the tiled backgrounds and clashing colors found in GeoCities, I feel these odd
                    design
                    choices create a lot of webpages with personality. I am hoping to bring back these retro
                    aesthetics with a modern approach to webpage design. I would like my blog to be like an ugly
                    sweater for the internet.</p>

                <p><strong> What is most challenging in terms of the visual design?</strong></p>
                <p> The biggest challenge in my blog design is with how to incorporate scroll bars for my
                    content in
                    a way that doesn’t hide the core elements of my content. I am also going to try to add fun
                    “easter eggs” around the site, but I hope it doesn’t come across as annoying or distracting
                    from
                    the main content. For example, I am wondering if there is a tasteful way to have MIDI music
                    play
                    on my webpage.
