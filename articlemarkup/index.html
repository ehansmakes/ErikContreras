                <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
                <p> The focus of my design research will be on consumer electronic products and product kits that
                    promote 1)
                    repairability, 2) upgradeability, 3) recyclability, and 4) emotional attachment between the user and
                    the
                    product. The goal is to increase product longevity, reduce resource use and the rate of e-waste
                    being
                    generated.
                    In addition, my research project will incorporate a “Do It Yourself” (or DIY) approach to consumer
                    product
                    design as a means to: 1) increase user emotional connectivity with their product, 2) increase user
                    physical
                    connectivity with their product through ergonomics, 3) promote communal learning, 4) shift the power
                    relation
                    between consumer and producer, and 5) promote “technical literacy” with electronic products. I am
                    hoping
                    that
                    this approach in product design will lead to high-impact products for users and in turn low-impact
                    products for
                    the planet. I am planning to encompass my research under the terms “Design for Disassembly” and
                    “Design
                    for
                    Emotional Connection” given my hopes of creating products with a circular lifecycle or a “cradle to
                    cradle” life
                    cycle that users will cherish for years to come. Research will encompass potential product
                    prototypes
                    and
                    end-user input. </p>

                <h3>RATIONALE JUSTIFICATION</h3>

                <p>There are three global conflicts that have motivated my research in designing products for
                    disassembly
                    and
                    emotional connection: 1) the poor recycling methods for electronic waste, 2) the current fight for
                    the
                    Right to
                    Repair in the United States, and 3) the power dynamics found in the consumer culture. </p>

                <p>Electronic waste (E-Waste), the first conflict, has been one of the best kept dirty secrets of
                    consumer
                    electronic products. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found that only 15–20%
                    of
                    e-waste
                    is recycled . . . the rest of these electronics go directly into landfills, incinerators
                    (Statistics,
                    2012) or
                    to developing countries where the waste is “informally processed” (see Figure 1). This informal
                    processing of
                    e-waste has led to adverse human health effects and environmental pollution. With many electronic
                    components
                    containing potentially harmful materials such as: lead, cadmium, beryllium, or brominated flame
                    retardants
                    (Sakar, 2016), e-waste is not only poisoning local communities, but is slowly killing the planet.
                    This
                    exploitation by developed countries of the less-powerful developing countries can be viewed as a
                    continuation of
                    the evils of colonization that has plagued developing nations for centuries. Yet, the effects of the
                    mismanagement of processing e-waste cross all country borders because e-waste contributes to the
                    problems of
                    global warming and pollution of the planet. Dumping our unwanted (toxic) trash overseas is not
                    sustainable and
                    this dirty little secret needs to be fully exposed.</p>

                    This area is known as a "digital dumping ground", where they allege millions of tons of e-waste are
                    processed
                    each year. Photo: (Marlenenapoli, 2012)</p>

                <p>E-waste management is only a small conflict when compared to the war for the Right to Repair, the
                    second
                    mentioned conflict. Here, individuals and small-businesses are pitted against corporations and
                    lobbyists
                    for the
                    rights of ownership over a purchased electronic product. On one hand, the individuals and
                    small-businesses are
                    fighting for the right to repair a product to extend its life. Not only does this lead to the
                    greater
                    virtue of
                    a cleaner planet, but it also helps the customer step away from the consumer culture and save money.
                    On
                    the
                    other hand, the corporations and their lobbyists are fighting hard against the Right to Repair given
                    that the
                    less likely we can repair our old products, the more likely we will consume a new product instead.
                    To
                    make
                    matters worse, companies are now more than ever motivated to incorporate planned obsolescence into
                    their
                    product
                    design given that technology trends are stabilizing. It is hypothesized that by 2025, the
                    observation
                    that the
                    number of transistors in a dense integrated-circuit doubles about every two years, Moore’s Law, will
                    come to an
                    end (Markoff, 2015). An example of Moore’s Law in action can be seen in Figure 2. The era of annual
                    improvements
                    for faster, cheaper, smaller or lighter electronics is nearing its deathbed. In order to maintain
                    the
                    rapid
                    growth they experienced in the past, corporations are more inclined to artificially recreate the
                    rapid
                    growth
                    through advertisements, consumer culture, “faux-innovation”, and removing ways for consumers to
                    repair
                    and
                    upgrade their products to prolong its life.

                <p>“Faux-innovation” is a common trend that is a by-product of the stabilization of technology. This
                    trend
                    is the
                    kludging together of unrelated technologies in an attempt to appear innovative to the consumer. An
                    example of
                    this can be seen in the Juicero (see Figure 3), a $400, wi-fi connected “smart” juicer that only
                    uses
                    single-serving packets of pre-juiced fruits and vegetables that could only be purchased directly
                    from
                    the
                    company. Even though Juicero received $120 million in startup venture capital, the product was
                    considered as “a
                    solution that was looking for a problem” by its critics and the company closed after only a year of
                    releasing
                    their “smart” juicer. Not only was this venture a waste of money, but it contributed to the growing
                    e-waste
                    problem without the virtue of providing a useful service for the customer. </p>

                </p>

                <p>By continuing to structure their business model around the unsustainable growth of technology from
                    past
                    decades, corporations are reverting to shady business practices rather than adapting and
                    restructuring
                    for the future. These practices not only hurt the individual consumer, but more importantly, they
                    poison
                    the earth by churning-out more and more products that prematurely turn into e-waste, thereby
                    polluting
                    and harming the developing countries that are used as our dumping grounds. Specific large, impactful
                    corporations that are on the wrong side of this fight include: Microsoft, Apple, and John Deere.
                </p>

                <p>On a larger scale, certain American politicians, such as Assemblymember Susan Eggman of the Stockton
                    District in California, are pushing for legislation for the Right to Repair Act which “would require
                    manufacturers of electronics to make diagnostic and repair information, as well as equipment or
                    service
                    parts, available to product owners and independent repair shops“ (Susan Eggman). Since 2012,
                    eighteen
                    U.S. states have proposed a Right to Repair Act. Sadly out of those eighteen, zero states have
                    passed
                    Right to Repair legislation. The most recent fight has been happening in California, where a Right
                    to
                    Repair bill was proposed in March of 2018, postponed and then scheduled for a vote in January 2020,
                    at
                    the earliest. Currently the vote has still not occurred. Heavy lobbying by tech corporations have
                    been
                    the main reasons for this postponement as this legislation has the potential of starting a
                    revolution in
                    ethical design of consumer products as it shifts power away from the corporations and towards the
                    individual.
                </p>

                <p>While this proposal has demonized corporations with broad strokes, there are a few companies that are
                    the
                    exception. One example is Fairphone, a company that has developed and is currently selling
                    smartphones
                    that promote repairability and upgradeability through its modular design since 2013. This year,
                    Fairphone has been continuing their design ideals with the release of the Fairphone 3 that is
                    selling
                    for only 450 euros or roughly 500 US dollars (Figure 4). Their products have not only been praised
                    by
                    Right to Repair advocates, but also by consumers whose purchases have allowed Fairphone to continue
                    developing their products to this day. This business structure is something I would want to emulate
                    in
                    my research and development of electronic DIY product kits.

                </p>

                <p>Another key company of note is iFixit which sells repair tools for electronics, provides open-source
                    repair guides and promotes Right to Repair legislation. iFixit was “founded in 2003 as a result of
                    Kyle
                    Wiens’ (one of the founders) not finding an Apple iBook G3 repair manual” (Whitford, 2017). In order
                    to
                    keep individuals up-to-date with technology, iFixit provides teardown videos of new electronics just
                    weeks after their release. iFixit also provides a platform for individuals to post their own
                    teardown
                    videos. The success of the iFixit company is a great example of how supporting the Right to Repair
                    movement and helping to reduce e-waste can be lucrative for business, as iFixit was recently valued
                    at
                    21 million dollars (Whitford, 2017). This shows that companies can help people and the planet, while
                    also making a profit and funding the fight. This is another example of a business I am inspired by.
                </p>

                <p>While the majority of this proposal focuses on the physical attributes of fighting for ownership of
                    our
                    technology and the reduction of e-waste, there is an important philosophical issue at the heart of
                    the
                    third and final conflict: consumer culture and the dehumanization of the individual as a “consumer”.
                    In
                    1927, an American journalist wrote: “A change has come over our democracy. It is called
                    Consumptionism.
                    The American citizens’ first importance to its country is no longer that of citizen but that of
                    consumer” (Lubin, 2014). According to the Atlantic, the word “consumption” is originally derived
                    from
                    the Latin word “consumere” and first appeared in the French language in the 12th century, followed
                    by
                    the English language and later into other European languages. It meant “the using-up of food,
                    candles,
                    and other resources” (Trentmann, 2016). It is clear that the original definition of consumption
                    assumed
                    it to be an act that would continue until the resources were depleted. Further proof of this is
                    found in
                    the naming of one of the most feared diseases in the world, “consumption” for the “wasting disease”
                    tuberculosis, as the disease would ravage the entire body into nothingness. The definition change
                    from
                    consumption to consumer occurred during the post-World War One American economy of the 1920s, where
                    many
                    middle-class Americans experienced a decade of unprecedented prosperity (OpenStaxCollege, 2017).
                    With
                    this economic boom, more Americans found themselves having disposable income, which gave rise to the
                    advertisement industry.
                </p>

                <p>The sinister side to this economic growth came about when corporations realized that giving their
                    customers “everything they needed” would lead to a reduction of return customers. This led
                    corporations
                    to shift their marketing methods to a more psychologically manipulative approach in order to get
                    individuals to spend their money; such as creating a brand identity that the consumer can associate
                    a lifestyle with. Paul Mazur, a leading Wall Street banker, stated in 1927,</p>
                <blockquote cite = "https://www.businessinsider.com/birth-of-consumer-culture-2013-2"> 
                    “We must shift America from a
                    needs- to a desires-culture. People must be trained to desire, to want new things, even before the
                    old have been entirely consumed. […] Man’s desires must overshadow his needs” (Lubin, 2014).
                </blockquote>
                <p>This greed-fueled philosophy has been growing in American culture throughout the years as
                    corporations fight dirty to keep their profit margins up. </p>

                <p>There is potential to “hack” the current consumer culture; specifically with brand identity. By
                    focusing
                    research on product design that allows the user to assemble and customize their products through DIY
                    approaches, a stronger, more authentic identity between the end-user and product can be formed. This
                    flexibility in product design allows the end-user to be more direct on what he or she seeks in their
                    products. An argument for more DIY approaches in consumer products is that “people are not able to
                    express themselves through labour [in traditional consumer culture], which is presented as the
                    ‘real’
                    authentic side of human self-creation, they [the consumer] have to seek compensation in the ‘false
                    pleasures of consumption. Consumption in this sense eats away at their real selves” (Du Gay, 2001,
                    pp.
                    88). It is hypothesized that the act of assembly will provide the end user with a stronger emotional
                    connection with their product.

                <h3>PROJECT AND OBJECTIVE</h3>

                <p>The project that I am proposing for my research is to develop DIY kits of common electronic products
                    that
                    are used everyday but are often overlooked by the average consumer. These products include computer
                    keyboards, computer mice, and audio speakers. The goal is to have the user familiarize themselves
                    with
                    the parts that make up their products and hopefully form an emotional connection through the act of
                    assembly. There is also potential for a physical connection between the user and product through
                    rapid
                    prototype and ergonomics, such as creating a customized enclosure for a DIY computer mouse. </p>

                <p>These kits will incorporate the design philosophy of “Lateral Thinking with Seasoned Technology”; a
                    term
                    popularized by Gunpei Yokoi when developing the Nintendo Gameboy in 1989. This design philosophy
                    does
                    “not look for the state of the art but to utilize mature technology that can be mass-produced
                    cheaply
                    [for product design]” (Sheff, 1999). By using matured technology, there will be a consistent supply
                    chain of cheap parts and thorough literature to aid with troubleshooting potential issues.</p>

                <p>A current case study that relates to my research can be found in the subculture that has formed
                    around
                    mechanical keyboards. Most of the individuals from this subculture meet on the r/
                    MechanicalKeyboards
                    subreddit (online forum). There, they: 1) discuss different designs and products relating to
                    mechanical
                    keyboards, 2) show off their current keyboard builds, and 3) help newcomers get started with
                    building
                    their first mechanical keyboard. In addition to a strong community, there is also a strong parts
                    market
                    that accommodates to the demands of this subculture. This includes selling: 1) artisanal handmade
                    keycaps, 2) a wide variety of switch mechanical designs, and 3) custom made keyboard enclosures.
                    Given
                    how informed many of the individuals from this subculture are, there is a relatively leveled playing
                    field between the consumer and producer. This DIY approach also fosters a strong emotional
                    connection
                    between the user and their product (the keyboard). This can be seen in the vast personalization of
                    keyboards that can become an extension of each user's personality as well as provide any special
                    needs
                    to their product. </p>

                <h3>RESEARCH METHOD</h3>

                <p>The current audience that I am focusing my research on is the Maker movement, a subculture
                    representing a
                    technology-based extension of the DIY culture. I feel this community would be able to provide
                    valuable
                    input on my work and could bring up improvements for my project. Later, I hope to expand my research
                    to
                    two additional groups: 1) a group tangentially related to the Maker movement; college students, and
                    2) a
                    group lacking any background in DIY projects; general public. By the time the general public is
                    involved, the product should have undergone a variety of quality tests from the Maker movement group
                    and
                    college student group.
                </p>

                <p>Currently, I am using immersion observation with the Maker Movement to get a better understanding of
                    the
                    culture. My hope is that this will allow me to format my project ideas and prototypes in a way that
                    would generate natural responses from this community. These immersion observations include reading
                    the
                    quarterly copies of Make Magazine, attending the Maker Faire in the Bay Area, and following key
                    individuals from this community (Adam Savage, Simone Giertz, etc.) </p>

                <p>I am also planning to use participant observation in my research by providing content for the Maker
                    community. This includes: 1) uploading my 3D printed models of my DIY electronic product kits to
                    Thingiverse, 2) providing how-to videos on assembling my DIY electronic product kits on YouTube, 3)
                    selling DIY electronic product kits on Etsy, and 4) uploading photos of my DIY kits to Instagram. My
                    hopes with casting a “wide-net” using social media is that it would provide a genuine audience from
                    the
                    Maker community that would lead to critical input on my projects. It should be noted that I am
                    checking
                    with the Institutional Review Board regarding the Etsy shop. I am unsure if this input from the
                    Maker
                    community could be considered as a focus group interview, given that there is no moderator. I am
                    also
                    hoping to use the online forums on Reddit to showcase my DIY kits and get online feedback.</p>

                <p>I am also going to use critical discourse analysis (CDA) in my research to show that the act of
                    repair
                    and modification of consumer products shifts the power balance from corporations to the individual;
                    from
                    producer to consumer.</p>

            <section id="TIMETABLE">
                <h3>TIMETABLE</h3>

                <p>I plan to start prototyping potential product kits over this Spring Break. During the Spring Quarter
                    2020, I hope to work closely with Jiayi Young and Tom Maiorana with finalizing the first prototype
                    kit
                    as well as working on the marketing, in order to get my first test group, the Maker community,
                    interested in working with my kit. This testing will continue throughout the Summer, and the results
                    will be reviewed in the Fall Quarter to determine if more refinement is needed or if the second
                    (college
                    students) and third (general public) test groups can be included.</p>

                <p>I am hoping to find employment in the field of product design after completing my graduate degree at
                    UC
                    Davis, which is why I am planning to conduct individual interviews with product designers in
                    industry
                    throughout this process. I hope these interviews will provide a good scope of proper practices and
                    procedures that future employers are looking for in a product designer. </p>

                <h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>
                <p>I have a background in mechanical engineering with a focus in manufacturing. I am hoping to use this
                    skill set to develop adaptive manufacturing methods that use consumer grade additive manufacturing
                    to
                    facilitate the customers needs without much technical knowledge. Through my background in restoring
                    and
                    modifying old consumer products from the 1980’s and 1990’s, I hope I can learn from their design
                    successes (and failures) to create products that invite the user to assemble, disassemble, and
                    modify
                    based on their needs.
